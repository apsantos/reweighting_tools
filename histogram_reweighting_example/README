Example for doing 1-component histogram reweghting using entropy.x
H4T4 nonionic lattice surfactant as an example.
Reproducing some results from:
    Floriano et al. Langmuir, 1999
    (paper in this folder)

his*dat files
    These files contain a tally of the number of times a certain number of
    particles (N) and energy (E) are visited during a simulation.

    Format
    N <Nenergy> <EnergyBinMin>
    <Histogram_EbinMin> <Histogram_EbinMin+1> ... <Histogram_EbinMin+7>
    <Histogram_EbinMin+8> <Histogram_EbinMin+9> ... <Histogram_EbinMin+14>
    ...
    
    where           N     : number of particles
                <Nenergy> : Number of energy bins that are occupied for N particles
           <EnergyBinMin> : The value of the lowest energy bin occupied by N particles
    <Histogram_EbinMin+i> : The number of times this energy bin and N particles
                            happened in the simulation

The README in the above directory should guide the use of these histograms
